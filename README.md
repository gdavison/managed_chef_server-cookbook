# managed_chef_server

Deploys and configures the Chef server in a relatively stateless model. The included [policyfiles](policyfiles) provide examples of deployment options and the required attributes. You will need to pass

    node['chef-server']['accept_license'] = true

for Chef Server 13 (note that Chef Client 14 with Chef Server 13 has issues accepting licenses).

# Recipes

## default ##

Installs the Chef Server in a new deployment, wrapping the [Chef-Server](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-server) cookbook. You will need to use the `managed_organization` recipe or provide your own organizations recipe to use the other recipes.

## managed_organization ##

This creates a managed Chef organization and an org-managing admin user through the appropriate [attributes](attributes/default.rb#24).

## restore ##

Restores the Chef Server in a new deployment, including the `default` recipe. It looks for the existence of a [knife-ec-backup](https://github.com/chef/knife-ec-backup) tarball to restore from, configured with the `node['mcs']['restore']['file']` attribute.

## backup ##

Runs `knife ec backup` via cron and puts the backups in the `node['mcs']['backup']['dir']`. The default is 2:30am daily, but you may change the cron schedule via the following attributes.

    node['mcs']['backup']['cron']['minute'] = '30'
    node['mcs']['backup']['cron']['hour'] = '2'
    node['mcs']['backup']['cron']['day'] = '*'
    node['mcs']['backup']['cron']['month'] = '*'
    node['mcs']['backup']['cron']['weekday'] = '*'

## cron ##

Schedules the Chef client to run on the Chef server via cron against a provided policyfile archive. This may be set to use `--local-mode`, for when the Chef client has no other Chef server to contact. See the example [policyfiles/cron.rb](policyfiles/cron.rb) and [kitchen.yml](kitchen.yml) for reference.

## data_bag_loader ##

The `node['mcs']['data_bags']['dir']` is compared against the existing data bags on the server and creates and/or updates them as necessary. If the `node['mcs']['data_bags']['prune']` attribute is `true` then the data bags and their items are deleted if they exist on the server but do not have the requisite JSON files.

## legacy_loader ##

Takes the `node['mcs']['cookbooks']['dir']`, `node['mcs']['environments']['dir']` and `node['mcs']['roles']['dir']` directories and loads whatever content is found into the Chef server organization. If you want to use the same directory for the roles and environments the recipe can distinguish between JSON files. The cookbooks are expected to be tarballs in a directory, they will all be attempted to load via their `Berksfile` or with `knife`. For legacy cookbooks with multiple dependencies it may take multiple runs to load everything.

## policyfile_loader ##

Takes the `node['mcs']['policyfile']['dir']` and parses any `.lock.json` files to determine which policyfile archives to load into the local Chef server. Policies will be assigned to the group designated by the `node['mcs']['policyfile']['group']` attribute for the Chef server (`_default` is the default). If the policy itself sets the `node['mcs']['policyfile']['group']` attribute, the policy will be assigned to that group.

# Attributes
The [default.rb](attributes/default.rb) attributes file documents available settings and tunings.

# Custom Resources

Custom resources are used to reduce the complexity of the included recipes.

## managed_organization

The `:create` action will instantiate a Chef server organization with an internal administrator user. The name properties is the `organization`. The organization's `full_name`, `email`, and `password` are all optional properties.

## managed_chef_server_backup

This resource schedules backups of the Chef server via cron-style properties (`minute`, `hour`, `day`, `month`, `weekday`). The backups are written to the `directory` and their filenames start with the `prefix`.

## managed_chef_server_cron

This resource requires an `archive` property specifying the policyfile archive to deploy and use for running via `cron`.

## managed_chef_server_restore

This resource requires a `tarball` property specifying the `knife ec backup` tarball to restore from.

## cookbook_loader

This resource runs `berks` or `knife` against the `directory` property specifying the source for the cookbook tarballs to keep in sync with the server.

## data_bag_loader

This resource works off of the `directory` property specifying the source for the data bags to keep in sync with the server.

## managed_data_bag

This has `:create`, `:prune`, `:item_create`, and `:item_prune` for managing the data bags available on the server. This custom resource is called from the `data_bag_loader` resource.

## environments_loader

All of the Ruby or JSON environment files in the `directory` will be loaded onto the Chef Server and updated if they change.

## policyfile_loader

This resource looks for policyfile locks and archives in the `directory` specifying the source, only uploading them if they have been updated.

## roles_loader

All of the Ruby or JSON role files in the `directory` will be loaded onto the Chef Server and updated if they change.

# Testing

There is a [kitchen.yml](kitchen.yml) that may be used for testing with Vagrant. The [kitchen.vagrant.yml](kitchen.vagrant.yml) may be symlinked as **kitchen.local.yml** and used with local caches to speed up testing. If you want to use Docker, [kitchen.dokken.yml](kitchen.dokken.yml) may be used but it does not persist changes between runs and is thus not significantly faster (it's slower than Vagrant with caching). The following Suites map to example [policyfiles](policyfiles) that may be repurposed as necessary, with variants for testing Chef 14 and 15 of each:

## default

Tests simple installation and creation of the managed Chef user and organization.

## restore

Restores the Chef server from a backup with policyfiles. `kitchen verify restore` ensures the policyfiles were restored properly.

## cron

Checks the chef-client is in the crontab

## backup

Checks the backup script is in the crontab and backup directories are available.

## data_bags

Adds loading data bags from the included [test](test) directory. It restores from a previous data bag backup to ensure pruning and updating work.

## policyfile

Adds loading policyfiles from the included [test](test) directory.

## legacy

Adds loading cookbooks, environments and roles from the included [test](test) directory.

## everything

Installs the Chef server, restores from a backup, attempts to load policyfiles (which are included in the restored backup) and adds backup via cron.
